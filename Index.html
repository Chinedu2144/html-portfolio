    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      I am a highly motivated professional transitioning into a dedicated
      software development and analysis role, driven by a passion for creating
      efficient, data-informed user experiences. My foundation is built on
      rigorous academic training, culminating in an M.Sc. from the Norwegian
      University of Life Sciences (NMBU).
    </p>
    <p>
      This background equipped me with advanced skills in critical thinking,
      complex analysis, and strategic problem-solvingâ€”the core attributes
      required for excellent engineering. This is further solidified by hands-on
      technical proficiency in HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT & REACT.
