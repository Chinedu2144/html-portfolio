<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Bridging Analysis & Code: From Strategy to Solution</h2>
<p> I am a highly motivated professional transitioning into a dedicated software development and analysis role, driven by a passion for creating efficient, data-informed user experiences.
My foundation is built on rigorous academic training, culminating in an M.Sc. from the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU). This background equipped me with advanced skills in critical thinking, complex analysis, and strategic problem-solvingâ€”the core attributes required for excellent engineering. This is further solidified by hands-on technical proficiency in Google Data Analytics, including tools like SQL, Tableau, and Power BI.
  </p>

<p>My professional journey in leadership and process management has sharpened my focus on efficiency and user flow. I excel at taking ambiguous problems, clarifying requirements, and delivering organized, measurable results.</p>

<p>I am actively pursuing my passion for building solutions through development, specializing in front-end technologies and the modern web stack. My technical focus includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML & CSS: Creating responsive, accessible, and aesthetically pleasing user interfaces.</li>
  <li>JavaScript & React: Developing modern, high-performance web applications and dynamic user components.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am seeking a developer or development-focused analyst position where I can combine my strategic analytical abilities with my growing technical skills to build robust, user-centric products.
